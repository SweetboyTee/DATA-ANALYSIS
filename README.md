# DATA-ANALYSIS
 This is a Covid19 Analysis with Focus on Nigeria

The dataset for this project was gotten from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 'owid-covid-data'

I had to breake the dataset into two 'Covid_Deaths_Info' and 'Covid_Vaccination_Info' 
the breakage was done to showcase my SQL skill. this can be found in the SQL folder 'Covid19' here i just had to do some Joins and checkout for what i actually needed for my visualization

After i had finished my exploration with the 'Covid19' and i was ready to carry on with my analysis proper, I had open up a new query file to write clean SQL code 'Covid19 Queries for Tableau Visualization' for my Visualization

Looking at my 'Covid19 Queries for Tableau Visualization' I had to do a copy and paste into excel because Tableau doesn't connect to SQL

you can find the these excel files in the Viz dataset folder 

after my dataset for visualization was set, i quickly moved to Tableau for my visualization.

you can see a snipshot of my visualization in my VISUALIZATION folder 'Covid19 Tableau Visualization'
