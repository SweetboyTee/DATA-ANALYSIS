This is a housing report that is focused on Nigeria

The dataset was gotten from data.gov which can be found in the dataset folder

The Visualization was done with the understanding of Real Estate
Here in Nigeria when looking for an apartment, you need to consider how many bathrooms, bedrooms, parkingspace, location and then the price of the apartment

With this understanding, i deccied to make sliders for the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and packing space so that the client can choose what suits them
then i used a slicer for the types of apartments and edited them so fine that the clent can choose just the type of house he is looking for.

Then comes the locations of the houses, these are placed by states and cities.
The client can see how man of his choice of houses are in each state, the client can then click on their prefeared state
and see the number of houses are there in each city and also the average price of the house in that city.
